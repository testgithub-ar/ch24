10. JDK is a Java Development kit ,verified by the Oracle with version 8.It basically includes Tools and JRE.JDK is used to write the program.
    JRE is Java run time environment ,it basically includes tols and jvm .It is used to run the program and it us platform dependent.
    JVM is a is Java Virtual Machine which is used to execute the program .It looks for the main method.

11.jvm executes the program.
   It converts the program into byte code.
   when it is executed the heap memory is created
   
12.Java is platform independent because we write code once and run on any platform

13. Class is a set of object which shares common charactoristics and attributes.It is also a keywor used to define the object.

14.Keyword are some charactoristics in java ,which re used to store some data.
    ex:public,static,if,else,while,do etc
15. variable is a name refered to a datatype ,which stores adress or location of a value.

16. Local Variable is a variable declared inside a method of a body.

17. Data types in java are used to store the information.
    There are basically two types od data types,
     1. Premitive:which is inbuilt,there are 8 types
        byte,short,int,long,float,double,boolean and char.
     2.Non premitive which incudes String and arrays.

    Ex: string,int etc

18. main method in java is a method with which we execute the program,jvm is always looking for main method to execute the program.
    the syntax to write a main method is :
class Win{
}
    public static void main(String[] args)
{
}
In the above syntax public is a Access Specifier,which are four types 1. public 2.private 3. protected 4. package default.
static is keyword or non access specifier
void is a return type
main is a name of a method
string is a parameterand args are the refernces passing to parameters.

19. static method is a method used to declare a method,in which we can invoke another method.
    we can invoke only static method inside the static method, to inoke non static method we have to use instances
    The syntax for static method is :
class Cricket{
}
    public static void hit()
{

}

20. Program to check the number is even or odd.

  class Android
{
public static void text( int number)
{
System.out.println("running text in android");
System.out.println("number"+number);

if(number%2==0)
{
System.out.println("the given number is even");
}
else
{
System.out.println("the given number is odd");
}

}
 public static void main(String[] args)
{
System.out.println("running main in android");
Android.text(5);

}

}
